# Smart Home Water Motor

## Overview

This project presents a smart home water motor control system designed to optimize water usage and energy efficiency. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the water level in an overhead tank and a relay module to control the water motor. The integration of these components with a microcontroller enables intelligent decision-making based on real-time water level data.
